    "### Conditions for applying Z or t Hypothesis:\n",
    "1. Sample needs to be random or normally distributed or the histogram of the sample distribution \n",
    "   should be somewhat normal with no outliers or skeweness.\n",
    "2. Large sample size ( n > 30).\n",

    "1. It is given that the mean breaking strength is normal.\n",
    "2. Although, the sample size is small ( n = 9 ) but it's distribution is normal \n",
